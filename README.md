# Battle-Boats
- A game based off of the popular board game Battle Ships.
- Made as a project assignment for my computer science course.
- All the programming, developing and assets including music and images were all made by Lee Lawler
- Sounds explosion.mp3 and splash.mp3 (played when you either miss or sink a battleship) were taken from youtube.

- Then run the BattleBoats.exe
